# Depth-first values challenge

In depth-first search, a given subtree is explored as deeply as possible before the search continues on to another subtree. For a binary search tree, an in order traversal returns the nodes in sorted order.

## Instructions

Depth-first search is an inherently recursive operation which continues to explore further subtrees so long as child nodes are present. Be sure to return the integer values at each node in the array, not the nodes themselves. Finally, return null if the tree is empty.
