# Coding challenges

The repositories in this section contain solutions to various coding challenges I have encountered throughout my career. They are sourced from [Free Code Camp](https://freecodecamp.org), [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/), and enterprise-level corporations (including Meta, Google, and Microsoft).

Each repository contains an `overview.md` file where I describe the challenge in detail, explain the underlying concepts involved, and indicate which data structures are required to complete the problem. There is also a `instructions.md` file containing the original problem as it was presented to me. My working solutions are usually written in JavaScript and/or PHP (`solution.js` or `solution.php`).
